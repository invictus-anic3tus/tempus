## 10/2/2025 - Did a bit of brainstorming  

For the past little while, I've been simply brainstorming how this watch is going to function, particularly with the microphone. Currently, the microphone is in a pretty unfortunate spot on the PCB, and I'm not sure how well it'll pick up sound. I've thought about moving it to a separate PCB that I mount sideways in the case, to get much closer to the user's mouth, but I'm not sure how feasible it'd be. I'd have to add testing pads for soldering wires to connect the two PCBs, which may be challenging to route.

Other than that, I did some research regarding how I'd receive and send texts on the watch, and found that I can do it, but only with Android. That's OK, still. I also looked at using the microphone on the watch during calls, but since ESP32s can't act as Bluetooth microphones or speakers, it's pretty much impossible.
